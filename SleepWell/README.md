## 📜 Description
**SleepWell** is a lightweight, zero-dependency shutdown timer designed for late-night movie watchers and music listeners.

Unlike standard shutdown commands, SleepWell provides a soothing, flicker-free visual interface and a **smart volume decay** system that gently lowers your computer's volume as you fall asleep—ensuring you aren't woken up by loud action scenes or sudden track changes.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dreamy Visuals:** A calm, blue-themed ASCII interface with a smooth progress bar.
* **Native Volume Fade:** Automatically fades your system volume to 0% over the duration of the timer.
    * *No external tools required (No .exe).*
    * *Uses a temporary, invisible VBScript to simulate "Volume Down" key presses naturally.*
* **Smart Abort:** Press `X` at any time to cancel the shutdown and instantly return to the main menu.
* **Clean Exit:** Automatically restores your mouse cursor settings and cleans up temporary files upon exit.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1.  Download `sleepwell.bat`.
2.  **Run it directly.** (No installation needed).
3.  Select your duration (**15**, **30**, or **60** minutes).
4.  The script will handle the rest. Press `X` if you change your mind.

### 💡 Pro Tip
Move the file to your `C:\Windows` folder to run it from anywhere by simply typing `sleepwell` in your Start Menu or Run dialog (Win+R).
